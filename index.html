         2 years of Data Analyst with a Research Institute.Possess Master's and Bachelor's Degree in Statistics from University of Ilorin,Kwara State,Nigeria.I am an aspiring Software Engineer getting ready to be trained by Decagon Software Engineering Institute. I am a fast learner with a large capacity for growth and development.
         <br>
         I was opportuned to studied a numerate course in the university which covers the aspect of Data Analyis. We were introduced to a Data Analysis Software called R. R is a programming language and free 
         software environment for statistical computing. 
         I was exposed to programming while using R which i later fell in love with. After the end of my Master's Degree program, i develop interest in Software engineering which based solely on programming. To actualize the dream of becoming a Software Engineer becomes difficult, i was later informed by a friend about Decagon Software Engineering Institute.
         I applied for the Decagon elite software Engineering training with the aim of becoming a world class Software Engineer.
